Examples
========

In order to speed up even further the process of designing a *GNN*, we
provide a number of examples implemented by *IGNNITION*. We first
include a simple example which, despite not being a real-life example,
we believe can be very helpful as a beginners guide to implement a very
simple *GNN*, this being a *GNN* solving the *Shortest path problem*.

Additionally, we provide implementations of several reference papers
that include different typologies of GNN. Our hope is that, given this
implementations, most of the custom GNN can be produced just by making
some minor changes, which should help avoid any potential designing
issue. Also, in each of the respective directories of the use-cases
presented, we also provide a file containing a single sample of the
dataset to help the user to better understand the required structure of
the dataset.

Below you can find the list of examples implemented so far by
*IGNNITION*. Stay tuned as we plan to include many more examples soon:
