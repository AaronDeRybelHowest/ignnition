# RouteNet model with support for node-level features

This implementation is based on the model described at the following paper:<br>
"Towards more realistic network models based on Graph Neural Networks" [[Paper](https://personals.ac.upc.edu/pbarlet/papers/gnn.conext2019.pdf)]

This work extends the architecture of RouteNet to support different features on forwarding devices. The paper focuses on modeling networks where devices may have variable queue size.

The datasets used in this paper are not publicly available. However, we provide the implementation of this model as a useful reference for future works.
