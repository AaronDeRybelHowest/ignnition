1. Shortest-Path
----------------

Brief description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first illustrative example that we present is a *GNN* that aims to
solve the well-known *Shortest-Path* problem, which architecture is
considerably simpler than any of the other proposals that we present
below -and thus is a good starting point-. To learn more about this
model, check :ref:`quick-step-by-step-tutorial` where we explain in
depth the target problem, as well as the architecture of the resulting
*GNN*.
