# IGNNITION: A framework for fast prototyping of GNNs

*IGNNITION* is the ideal framework for users with no experience in neural network programming (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). With this framework, users can design and run their own GNN models in a matter of a few hours.

## Quick Start
### Installation
You can install *IGNNITION* with the following command using *PyPI*. You can find a more detailed explanation in our [installation guide](https://ignnition.net/doc/installation/)
```
pip install ignnition
```
Alternatively, you can install it from the source code, using the following commands. These commands first download the source code, then prepare the environment and finally install the library.


```
wget 'https://github.com/knowledgedefinednetworking/ignnition'
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```


### Tutorial
To get started with *IGNNITION*, we have prepared a step-by-step tutorial that explains in detail how to design a basic GNN from scratch.
Click [here to start this tutorial](https://ignnition.net/doc/quick_tutorial/).

After this tutorial, you will be prepared to start designing [your own GNN model from scratch](https://ignnition.net/doc/intro/) or reuse any model from our [examples library](https://ignnition.net/doc/examples/) and adapt it to your needs. 

Please, follow our [documentation](https://ignnition.net/doc/) to know all the details of this framework.
